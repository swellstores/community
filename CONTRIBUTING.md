# Contribution Guide

1. Fork the repo.
2. Add your project to `README.md` in the most appropriate section following this format:
   - `- [Project name](Project URL) - A sentence that describes your project and what makes it interesting/unique.`
   - Make sure your description starts with an uppercase character and ends with a period.
   - Try to keep the line length (name + description) to 105 characters so it fits on a single line.
3. Commit changes with the format: `Add {project name}`.
4. If you can't find an appropriote heading, open a discussion in [Show and tell](https://github.com/orgs/swellstores/discussions/categories/show-and-tell).
5. Create a PR with your changes, and in the decription, describe in at least one sentence why you think the project is awesome and helpful to the community.
6. Give yourself a high five, or better yet, someone else.
